Description of the Website: Wisdom Distributor
Overview:
The "Wisdom Distributor" is a simple, elegant web application designed to inspire users by displaying motivational quotes. Users can generate random quotes with the click of a button. The quotes are fetched from an API or, in case of network issues, from a predefined fallback list of inspiring wisdom, including stoic and motivational themes.

How It Works:
Core Functionality:

The webpage has a minimalistic design that displays:
A motivational quote.
The author's name.
A button labeled "Get Quote" to fetch a new piece of wisdom.
Backend Logic:

Primary Source: The app attempts to fetch quotes from the Quotable API.
Fallback Mode: If the API is unreachable, it randomly selects quotes from a robust local collection stored in the script.js file.
Styling:

The design features a modern, responsive layout with a dark, gaming-inspired theme.
CSS ensures the app is visually appealing on both desktop and mobile devices.
